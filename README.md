## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at IIT Bombay, studying Chemistry; who loves anything to do with computers, science and art. 

## Research Interests

My primary interests lie in computational chemistry and quantum chemistry with a focus on implementing machine learning in research settings. I have a specific interest in supramolecular chemistry and applications of self-assembling nanostructures.

I also enjoy astrophysics and large-scale bioinformatics.

## Skills

1) Proficient in Python 

2) Implementing MD simulations using OpenMM/OpenFF or CharMM-GUI

3) Basic machine learning algorithms using TensorFlow/Keras

4) Basic Quantum Chemistry
